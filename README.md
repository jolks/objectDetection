--> COCO

The COCO Object Detection Task is designed to push the state of the art in object detection forward. COCO features two object detection tasks: using either bounding box output or object segmentation output (the latter is also known as instance segmentation). 
The COCO train, validation, and test sets, containing more than 200,000 images and 80 object categories,
All object instances are annotated with a detailed segmentation mask. Annotations on the training and validation sets (with over 500,000 object instances segmented) are publicly available.
